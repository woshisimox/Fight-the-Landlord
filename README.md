# DouDiZhu (Suits-enabled, rules & UI unchanged)

- Adds **suit-aware physical cards** (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) while **keeping rules & UI unchanged** (compare ranks only).
- Supports singles, pairs, triples, bombs (four of a kind), and king-bomb (SJ+BJ). Sequences/attachments are intentionally omitted.
- Minimal Next.js + TypeScript app with one API endpoint to simulate rounds.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```
